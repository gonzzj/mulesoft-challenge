This is a challenge to visualize the dependency relations between these components. In order to do this, we will maintain a record of each installed component and the component dependencies.

## Getting Started

First, install all the packages:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Then, run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the application running.

## Useful commands

- Build application for deployment
```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```
- Run lint testing
```bash
npm run lint
# or
yarn lint
```
- Run unit tests
```bash
npm run test
# or
yarn test
```
- Run unit tests on watch mode
```bash
npm run test:watch
# or
yarn test:watch
```
- Run unit tests with coverage
```bash
npm run test:coverage
# or
yarn test:coverage
```

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy this app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
